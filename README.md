# ReactJS Developer Profile Set-2 Internship Test

This project is part of the ReactJS Developer Profile Set-2 Internship Test. The objective of this test is to create a ReactJS application with a user-friendly interface that interacts with the TVMaze API to display show names and details.

## Project Overview

The project is a ReactJS application consisting of two screens:
1. **Show List Screen**: This screen displays a list of show names along with relevant details fetched dynamically from the TVMaze API. Users can click on each show to view its summary.
2. **Show Summary Screen**: This screen displays a summary of a particular show selected from the Show List Screen. Additionally, users can book movie tickets for the selected show.

## Features

- Fetch show data dynamically from the TVMaze API.
- Display show names and details on the Show List Screen.
- Allow users to view show summaries on a separate screen.
- Enable users to book movie tickets with pre-filled show details.
- Utilize local/session storage for storing user details to enhance user experience.
- Implement proper UI/UX principles for a visually appealing interface.
